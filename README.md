.NET PG final project

Program's basic functionality is as follows:

The assumption is made that user wants to, for example, work on theirs discipline.

User can input their own activity by using the "Add Event" button, then assign a weekday when it is wished to be performed, name, length (time) and a type to it. For now, there are left some test objects notto input them each time openinig app.
User then can see his full weekly agenda.
Then, in main program, the tasks for certain weekday are displayed with a timer, which enables user to follow how long he should be working on pre-set task.
User will be enabled to start and stop activity whenever he wants (so it's not necessary to do any activity for one sitting), and the goal is to complete all tasks assigned to actual day.
